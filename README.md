# DM2008 — Programming for Interaction

This repository contains all materials, templates, and examples for **DM2008: Programming for Interaction**.  
It serves as the single reference point for in-class activities, demos, and code templates throughout the semester.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### `weekly_lessons/`

Weekly folders containing class demos and activities.

Each week corresponds to a topic covered in class:
| Folder | Focus |
|---------|--------|
| `week_01` | Introduction to Creative Coding and p5.js basics |
| `week_02` | Conditionals and Loops |
| `week_03` | Arrays and Functions |
| `week_04` | Object-Oriented Programming (Part 1) |
| `week_05` | Object Interaction and State Management |
| `week_06` | Media Loading and Code Review |
| `week_08` | Arduino Basics and Blink Demo |

Within each week, you’ll find folders for specific **activities**, **readings**, or **mini-projects** used during class.

> ⚠️ Weeks 09–13 focus on Arduino, data, and final projects — materials will be added progressively.

---

### `starter_templates/`

Clean, ready-to-use project templates for your own sketches.

- **p5-only/** → browser-based sketches

  - `fixed-size/` : fixed canvas dimensions
  - `window-size/` : responsive full-window canvas

- **p5-arduino/** → templates that include serial communication setup between Arduino and p5.js

Each folder includes its own `README.md` explaining how to use or modify the template.

---

### `weekly_lessons/libraries/`

Local copies of required p5.js libraries for offline use:

- `p5.min.js`
- `p5.sound.min.js`

These are already linked in the starter templates.

## 🧑‍🏫 About This Course

**DM2008: Programming for Interaction** introduces coding as a creative practice for interaction & game designers.
You’ll learn to think computationally, experiment fearlessly, and build interactive experiences that connect screen, sound, and sensor.

The course emphasizes:
• Playful experimentation
• Confidence through process and iteration
• Embracing debugging and “productive confusion” as part of learning
